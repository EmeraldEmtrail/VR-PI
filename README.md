# VR-PI
Hi hello and welcome!
This is the github repository for the VR-PI(Vr-Pi)
i will post updates here when i get progress and have a video with it.
YOU NEED A MOBILE VR HEADSET(one thet you put a phone in)
specs for this do not matter as long as you can 3d print something if it does not fit correctly.
due to each being diffrent i can not provide 3d models.
IF DO NOT HAVE A 3D PRINTER USE PCB WAY
